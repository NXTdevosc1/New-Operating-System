These are the things that makes this OS Standout from other Operating Systems.

- [Kernel Core] Superior Task Scheduler, for servers or high performance requiring processes, the user can select the task execution granularity to be eather manual (the user selects the absolute % of cpu usage) or dynamic (cpu usage is determined by the scheduler).
- [Kernel Core] Ultimate Performance mode, in addition the user can select this mode in combinasion with dynamic scheduling mode to use the maximum possible cpu performance while the cpu is in a manageable temperature. Which is around 80% cpu usage in most sockets.

- [EODX Subsystem] 3D Software acceleration, the EODX Subsystem lets the user decide wether it is possible for the cpu to cooperate with the gpu in graphics computing.

- [EODX Subsystem] Partial 3D Drawing, the EODX Subsystem only draws what changed in the frame.

- [Kernel Core] Multi dimensional Software Caching, for HDDs and SSDs without DRAM, this can vastly increase performance. The user can select the amount of memory to be used to cache the files and the file allocation table.

- [Kernel Core] Safer shutdowns, the ob and io subsystems makes sure to terminate all open procedures before shutting down the system.

- [Kernel Core] Safer software license, unlike windows there is no way to hack our software ;)
- To benefit from these advanced features, the user has to subcribe to a yearly fee of only 29.99$/year nstead of 99.99$/year.

- [PNP Management Subsystem] To ensure user security, the OS provides in the device manager with a description of the active usage of each device (which are the open handles on the device and their permissions and the process using them).

- [Kernel Core] Emergency Mode : And no this is not the emm present in devices such as smartphones, This mode can be enabled with the keybinds (Ctrl+Alt+Del). This mode freezes all the running threads on the system, and keeps the standard system threads running. It opens a kernel mode console in which the user can either enable "startup emergency safe mode" for a specialist to fix the problem later, or he can fix it himself.
This is usually in case the user thinks a malware entered the computer.

- [Whole Operating System] Abnormally impressive optimization, all the software is highly optimized and way faster than any other product operating system on earth!

- Lower Memory Usage (The OS is very compact and does not use much memory)
- Faster Loading (Only required drivers are initilized and the OS is getting rid of old devices such as PIT, MP Tables...)
- Security (Subsystems use a secure object manager which makes them immune against all types of attacks) {
	- Password mode, a user application can declare that a user is writing a password into an input. This will prevent other applications from reading keyboard input while in background.
	- SafeRegistry : A database where programs can safely put passwords, emails, tokens and other data without other programs having access to it.
}
- Advanced MultiTasking (Use all of your cpu power with a controllable task scheduling system, and configureable cpu power consumption and usage)

- [Security Subsystem] Superior Security, low bug probability (All tasks are executed atomically between processors, cache check)
