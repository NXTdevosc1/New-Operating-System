These are the things that makes this OS Standout from other Operating Systems.

- Hardware Sharing (Two devices can share various hardware to increase performance and reliability such as GPUs, CPUs...) {
	This can be done by a Network Device or USB.
}
- Faster System (Everything is highly optimized)
- Lower Memory Usage (The OS is very compact and does not usage so much memory)
- Faster Loading (Only required drivers are initilized and the OS is getting rid of old devices such as PIT, MP Tables...)
- Security (Subsystems use a secure object manager which makes them immune against all types of attacks) {
	- Password mode, a user application can declare that a user is writing a password into an input. This will prevent other applications from reading keyboard input while in background.
	- SafeRegistry : A database where programs can safely put passwords, emails, tokens and other data without other programs having access to it.
}
- Advanced MultiTasking (Use all of your cpu power with a controllable task scheduling system, and configureable cpu power consumption and usage)
